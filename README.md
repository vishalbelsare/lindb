## Build

### Prerequisites

To build LinDB from source you require the following on your system.

- [Go >=1.21](https://golang.org/doc/install)
- [Make tool](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)
- [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)

### Get the code

```
git clone https://github.com/lindb/lindb.git
cd lindb
```

### Build from source

To build only LinDB core.(without web console)

```
make build
```

To build both LinDB core and frontend.

```
make build-all
```

### Test

```
make test
```

### Access web interface(for developer)

Start the node.js app to view LinDB web interface in dev mode.

```
cd web
yarn install 
yarn dev
```

You can access the LinDB web interface on your [localhost port 3000](http://localhost:3000/)

## Contributing

Contributions are welcomed and greatly appreciated. See [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md) for details on submitting patches and the contribution workflow.

#### CI 
Pull requests should be appropriately labeled, and linked to any relevant [bug or feature tracking issues](https://github.com/lindb/lindb/issues). 
All pull requests will run through GITHUB-Actions. Community contributors should be able to see the outcome of this process by looking at the checks on their PR and fix the build errors.

#### Static Analysis 
This project uses the following linters. Failure during the running of any of these tools results in a failed build. Generally, code must be adjusted to satisfy these tools.

- [gofmt](https://golang.org/cmd/gofmt/) - Gofmt checks whether code was gofmt-ed. By default this tool runs with -s option to check for code simplification;
- [golint](https://github.com/golang/lint) - Golint differs from gofmt. Gofmt reformats Go source code, whereas golint prints out style mistakes;
- [goimports](https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/tools/cmd/goimports) - Goimports does everything that gofmt does. Additionally it checks unused imports;
- [errcheck](https://github.com/kisielk/errcheck) - Errcheck is a program for checking for unchecked errors in go programs. These unchecked errors can be critical bugs in some cases;
- [gocyclo](https://github.com/alecthomas/gocyclo) - Computes and checks the cyclomatic complexity of functions;
- [maligned](https://github.com/mdempsky/maligned) - Tool to detect Go structs that would take less memory if their fields were sorted;
- [dupl](https://github.com/mibk/dupl) - Tool for code clone detection;
- [goconst](https://github.com/jgautheron/goconst) - Finds repeated strings that could be replaced by a constant;
- [gocritic](https://github.com/go-critic/go-critic) - The most opinionated Go source code linter;
